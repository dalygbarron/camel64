Oh man doing that coroutine stuff took so long I can barely remember what I was
actually doing before that.

I think I need to finish this sprite batcher system. We have got the atlases,
we just need to be able to use them all and load in the data. Not that much
work once I figure out a format etc.

Once we have atlases working it would be a good time to actually work on some
of the bullet hell stuff. We should be able to design it so that the character
graphics can translate easily from 2D sprites to 3D models when the time comes.

I'll just make a nice boss battle or something then we can worry about other
concerns.
