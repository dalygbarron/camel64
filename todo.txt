In the middle of making the multi texture batcher. As you will see, it provides
    a z axis value so that we can maintain painter's algorithm sorting while
    also switching textures, just need to maintain a z number and increment it
    or whatever.
    The only thing I don't exactly love is that we need to iterate over the
    sub batches to find the right texture. in practice it's only going to be
    going over a couple of so it won't be much of a speed drain but it's silly.
    Actually come to think of it, what we could do is we load the textures
    through the batch object and they become permanent fixtures of it. Then that
    means the sprites will also be associated with those batches, and so the
    drawing functions could be called directly on the sprites which then update
    the sub batches, then you just have to remember to call the main draw call
    on the overall batch object.
    Actually we can avoid the issue of alignment and make reading in the engine
    easier by just making the batcher generate a number of textures which all
    fit a size requirement of 64x64 or whatever.
